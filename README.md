# HackerRank_30_Days_of_Code
Here, I am uploading my solutions to HackerRank - 30 Days of Code streak. Mostly, I'll try to upload those codes which have been successfully accepted by HackerRank. However, if there are codes which I find difficult to deal with, I'll upload them anyway and leave it to the kind + competitive githibber's to find solutions. I'll mark incomplete codes seperately.


In this partcular code names day2_stackoverflow2.cxx , for test case of 10.25, 17, 5 my code on GCC Ubuntu 14+ compiler says 12 while the HackerRank compiler says 13 and does not accept my solution. But my code passes the rest 3 test cases on HackerRank. 

Kindly figure out whats wrong.

Thank you.
